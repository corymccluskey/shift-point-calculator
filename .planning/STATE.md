## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Single shift RPM for all gears (simpler interaction, covers primary use case)
- Phase 1: Connected shift line visualization (clearer than separate gear curves)
- Phase 1: All inputs as widgets (no code editing needed)
